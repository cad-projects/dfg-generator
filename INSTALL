To compile and install the DFG generation, simply run the install.py script as:

$./install.py <options>

Available options are:
* -compile-llvm: it downloads and compiles the LLVM compiler. It has to be provided only the first time the package is installed.
* -prefix=<path>: it specifies the target directory where all the resulting artifacts have to be installed (default=/opt/compiler). It has to be provided each time the library is compiled. Please, check to have permissions to write in the prefix path. 

The compilation process generates a configuration script (<prefix_path>/setup.sh) for simplifying the execution process.
