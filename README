=============
Executing the DFG generator
=============

The DFG generator operates on a specific representation produced by the installed LLVM 
compiler. To obtain this representation starting from a C code, execute the following
steps:

$source <prefix_path>/setup.sh
$clang -m32 -S -emit-llvm <source.c>
$opt <source.s> -mem2reg -instnamer -o obj.opt.s

After these steps, the DFG generator can be applied to the LLVM representation as follows:

XML representation:
$opt -load=cad-lib.so obj.opt.s -o /dev/null -dfg-printing -format="xml" -function=<name> 

dotty representation:
$opt -load=cad-lib.so obj.opt.s -o /dev/null -dfg-printing -format="dot" -function=<name>
